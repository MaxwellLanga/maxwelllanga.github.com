            <h2 class="titles">Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
            <time datetime="2021-10-21" class="date">January 20th, 2020</time>

                This week I read about an <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Article</a> that discussed the do’s and don’ts of form design when it comes user interaction and experience. The goal of the article, at least what I believe, was to teach products designers how to design online forms that users will want to fill out and finish. It discussed methods that designer can use to reduce user cognitive load.

                What is cognitive load you may ask? Well, it the amount of brain power that a user needs to complete or carryout a tack online. This can be filling out an application form for a loan, checking out after shopping online, buying a plane ticket, etc.

                One of the methods of reducing cognitive load, is by compartmentalization of your forms. This the breakdown of huge chunks of information into small non stressful bit of information. This helps the user not to lose focus of feel fatigued since they are being presented with small bits at a time.

                In addition to this, the article also talks about adding progression indicators for user. This simply means show a user their progress with a task so that it does not feel like an endless rabbit hole. This can be archived by adding a progress bar with different 1,2,3 steps. By not feeling as if the task is endless, the user has less cognitive load and a higher chance of completing the task.

                These are only a few of the methods that the article dives into. These are just ones that I felt were crucial to designing a good online form. Every single practice discussed in the article is important to designing products that make user experiences easier and simpler. This is our duty are designers.
