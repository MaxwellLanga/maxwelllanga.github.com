            <h2 class="titles">Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
            <time datetime="2021-10-21" class="date">January 20th, 2021</time>
            <p>
                This week I read about an <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Article</a> that discussed the do’s and don’ts of form design when it comes user interaction and experience. The goal of the article, at least what I believe, was to teach products designers how to design online forms that users will want to fill out and finish. It discussed methods that designer can use to reduce user cognitive load.
            </p>
            <p>
                What is cognitive load you may ask? Well, it the amount of brain power that a user needs to complete or carryout a tack online. This can be filling out an application form for a loan, checking out after shopping online, buying a plane ticket, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the methods of reducing cognitive load, is by compartmentalization of your forms. This the breakdown of huge chunks of information into small non stressful bit of information. This helps the user not to lose focus of feel fatigued since they are being presented with small bits at a time. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to this, the article also talks about adding progression indicators for user. This simply means show a user their progress with a task so that it does not feel like an endless rabbit hole. This can be archived by adding a progress bar with different 1,2,3 steps. By not feeling as if the task is endless, the user has less cognitive load and a higher chance of completing the task.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are only a few of the methods that the article dives into. These are just ones that I felt were crucial to designing a good online form. Every single practice discussed in the article is important to designing products that make user experiences easier and simpler. This is our duty are designers.

            <h2 class="titles">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows.</h2>
            <time datetime="2021-10-21" class="date">January 28th, 2021</time>
            <p>
                For this week, I take a look at what the best ways to design modals is in an <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">article</a> written by Naema Baskanderi. In her article, she discusses some of the best ways to design overlays in UI / UX so that they are not annoying destructive to the user. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Personally, I can agree with her that overlays have become popup windows and I also do find them annoying. If poorly designed, they get in the way of a user’s ability to complete a task. However, Naema mentions that they can be designed to work well.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the ways that this can be archived is to use them only when necessary. By this, she means that there are a few scenarios where modals are considered to work well. These being when you want to grab the user’s attention, need the user to input information like on a login or sign-up window, show additional information that is both is both related and not related ot the parent page.   
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to these scenarios, she also mentioned other elements that are crucial to making your modal work well. One of them being escape route for the user to leave the modal. This allows a user to close the modal at any given time. Another being a descriptive title that tell the user why they are seeing the modal. This can lead to them not getting frustrated by the modal and leaving the page entirely. 
            </p>
            <p>
                These are just some of the few factors that can help anyone design a better modal and make the life of a user easier.

            <h2 class="titles">Using Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</h2>
            <time datetime="2021-10-21" class="date">February 4th, 2021</time>
            <p>
                The article for today is about how we can use photographs to teach anyone, from children to grown adults, how to develop their reading and thinking skills using visuals.
            </p>
            <p>
                First off, photographs or visuals are a universal language and can be used to communicate to different people regardless of their background. So, in using pictures people can understand what you are trying to communicate.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is especially important when communicating with photographs. However, what’s more important is what different people interpret the photographs to be without being given any background information. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Whatever interpretation they come up with, it is not right or wrong. All that matters is that they have analyzed the photographs, looked for details and built their own assumptions based on their experiences and knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                In doing so, it develops their thinking skills by making them question different elements of photograph and in doing so, they can build templets of questioning that they can utilize in other fields. Additionally, by sharing their observations with other, they can foster debate and collaboration that will lead to the development of more ideas.
