            <h2>Comparison 1</h2>
            <p>
                To give context to my project, I found <a href="https://www.markuslerner.com/travelscope/#">markuslerner.com</a>markuslerner.com. It is a website that provides user with information about which countries they can travel to with their passports and nationality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Right off the bat when the screen loads with an interactive animation that grabs the user’s attention. It uses very minimal colors as to not draw attention away from the important information on the website. The website’s main color is green as a way of communicating peace and growth to a user.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you keep digging into the website, you will come across other colors like red and blue that both serve the purpose of representing travel bans and freedom of movement respectively. The font choice for the text on the website do a good job of not overpowering the main animation, which is the map. Additionally, the website gives a user the option to toggle between a globe and flat map which enhances the users experience. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Only thing that I would say does not work well on this website is the scrolling and dragging interaction with the map. Sometimes it drags or zoom when I do not intend to do so.
            </p>

            <h2>Comparison 2</h2>
            <p>
                This next website I choose is <a href="https://travelshift.com/">travelshift.com</a>. I only chose it because I liked the home page interaction with the mouse and circle that is constantly following the cursor around. When you press and hold down the cursor on the home page, the background cycles through a number of images that warp fade into the center of the screen. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, when this is happening, the color of the text on the page changes so as to correspond with the background color. This was very satisfying to look at and made me as a user want to keep watching the animation over and over again. The one thing that was confusing was the purpose of the website. Only thing I could get was that it was a travel booking website, but this is not 100% certainty.

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p>
                I really wanted to share more and give my website users an interactive process of exploring my road trip experience and learning from it. My goal is to have the same interface at the <a href="https://www.markuslerner.com/travelscope/#">markuslerner</a> website. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I want users to feel like they came along on the journey with me. I will use the map as an overlay and have users be able to click on the different hotspots that will be on the map. Hot spots will be locations that I have travel to on my road trips. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When users click on these hot spots, they will get information about the location and be able to see the pictures I took when I was there. The transitions between images and maps will hopefully be likes the transitions on the <a href="https://travelshift.com/">travelshift</a> website.
            </p>

        <article id="design">
            <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <p>
                In general, I am hoping to use a minimalist navy blue (dark blue) color scheme. This is meant to give the user a sense of calmness or relaxation. I will use san-serifs across my whole design as to keep with the minimalist aesthetic. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I will have the map in the center of the page and have it standout in with a unique color that will contract and complement the dark blue background. I am going to avoid any scrolling so that the user is not distracted by any other things and focuses on the map and the information it has. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The information about my trips will be in overlays that will appear and disappear when clicked. I will have small icons like plans and cars that will be in constant movement in the background.
            </p>

        <article id="interactive">
            <h2>Interative Strategies</h2>
            <p>
                Most of my animations will be triggered by user actions such as click or hover. At the start of the loading screen along with loading animation, I might experiment with sound. I am thinking of using a swooshing sound when the page is first opening and maybe pocking sounds when users click different areas. I hope this can enhance the experiences of the user. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I will also have very small movement that will happened when the user hovers over the map so as the draw focus to that point in the map. These movements might be a slight zoom and focus on the map location.

        <article id="experience">
            <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
            <p>
                I want my user to feel as if they are looking at paper map and when they lick or tap on a location, it zooms in and gives them information about my road trips. It will be like google maps just for my travel destinations. By the end of using my website, I want them to feel like they came with me on my journey, and they have learned about the different places I visited.
