        <h1>User Testing Results</h1>
        <p>
            Upon first loading the page, users were confused and did not really know where to click. After a few seconds, they would look at the title and then at the location in the bottom right conner. 
        </p>
        <p>
            They said that it took them a few seconds to realizes the needed to click the stars. During the feedback, they suggested maybe adding some sort of animation to the stars to get the users to click them. Additionally, on the overlay page, users had a hard time reading the description and suggested adding a background box so as to add contrast to it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Others suggested maybe making the background a little blurry. I considered this but I didnâ€™t want users to not looser focus on the image. I basically wanted them to see the whole image. In regard to the colors, users liked the color scheme and thought it fit my goal of sharing my journey. Overall, most of the feedback leaned towards making interactions on the website more obvious or easy for user to find.
        </p>

            Moving forward, I might reconsider using overlays and making everything work on one page. I will try to have different words and images show up when a user hovers over a star. Additionally, I will add animations to the stars so as to make then more obvious to click on when the page loads.
